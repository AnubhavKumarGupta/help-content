<b>Create Test Case - Help Guide</b><br><br>

This section guides you through creating a new test case with the following fields:<br><br>

<b>Form Fields:</b><br>
‚Ä¢ <b>Test Case Name:</b> Enter a descriptive name for the test case.<br>
‚Ä¢ <b>Source Connection:</b> Select the source database connection from the dropdown.<br>
‚Ä¢ <b>Fetch Source Table:</b> Click this button to fetch available tables from the selected connection.<br>
‚Ä¢ <b>Validation Types:</b> Choose one of the following options based on what you want to validate:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Schema Validation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Row Count Validation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Schema Validation + Row Count Validation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Column Data Validation<br><br>

<b>Table Mapping:</b><br>
This screen lets you map your source tables to target tables in the selected connection. 
Mappings enable data synchronization and integration between systems.<br><br>

<b>How to Use Table Mapping:</b><br>
‚Ä¢ Choose a <b>Target Connection</b> from the top dropdown to select where data will be mapped.<br>
‚Ä¢ Click <b>Fetch Target Table</b> to load the available tables from the selected connection.<br>
‚Ä¢ The <b>Source Table Name</b> panel (left) lists your source tables.<br>
‚Ä¢ The <b>Target Tables</b> panel (right) shows the tables available in your target connection and their current mappings (see "Mapped Tables").<br>
‚Ä¢ Mapped pairs appear in the <b>Mapped Tables</b> column. You can only map each target table to one source table.<br>
‚Ä¢ To remove an existing mapping, click the <b>Unmap</b> button in the Action column.<br>
‚Ä¢ Use <b>Previous</b> to go back, or <b>Next</b> to continue to the next step when all desired mappings are done.<br><br>

<b>Next Steps:</b><br>
After filling all required details and selecting the appropriate validation type, 
click <b>Save</b> to create and store the test case.<br><br>

<i>Tip: Use clear and descriptive names for your test cases to make them easier to identify later. Review mappings carefully to avoid misalignment between source and target tables.</i>
